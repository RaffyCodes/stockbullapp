# StockBull App
This app is a lightweight JS application that utilizes a public stock API to find the highest gaining stock for
that particular day. 

This application uses an async function to make the API call and then it parses the returned JSON object into a string so that the stock we want to display is easy to grab and insert onto the page. 


# Future Updates
Some future updates I would like to make are: 
- Dark Mode
- Update to us ReactJS instead of vanilla JS
- Add some sort of banner ad or monetization
- Feature top 10 highest gaining stocks?
- Update logo with something nicer
